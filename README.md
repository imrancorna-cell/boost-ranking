## Deploying to Vercel

This Next.js project is ready to be deployed to Vercel. Here are the steps to do it:

1.  **Download Your Code:** First, download the complete source code of your project from Firebase Studio. Look for an "Export" or "Download Code" option in the interface.

2.  **Push to a Git Repository:**
    *   Unzip the downloaded folder.
    *   Create a new repository on a Git provider like [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/), or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/).
    *   Follow your Git provider's instructions to push your local code to the new repository.

3.  **Import Project on Vercel:**
    *   Sign up for a free account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
    *   From your Vercel dashboard, click "Add New... > Project".
    *   Select the Git repository you just created. Vercel will automatically detect that it's a Next.js project.

4.  **Deploy:**
    *   Vercel will propose the correct build settings. You don't need to change anything.
    *   Click the "Deploy" button.

That's it! Vercel will build and deploy your site, providing you with a live URL. Your Firebase client-side configuration is already included in the code, so it will connect to your database without any extra steps.
